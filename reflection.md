Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

I learned how to concat and merge dataframes together, and especially when it is important to use which function. In addition, I learned the importance of using pivot tables as a form of grouping and sorting the data to get a specialized table output to better understand aspects of the data. In addition, I learned the importance of Extracting the data from online, doing the transformations such as cleaning columns, sorting data, and then putting in different tables, before loading the data as a final source. I was unfamiliar with the play.min.io but was familiar with S3 buckets from my 418 class and understood the process of storing the data in the cloud. This lab also showed me the importance of writing to csv to save dataframes and I had to learn how to update my path or directory on vscode to match my computer as I was having syntax errors. Overall, this lab was a great practice for merging, using pivots to access certain columns, and cleaning data to get exactly what I want from the data before loading the data to the cloud when it is finished.
